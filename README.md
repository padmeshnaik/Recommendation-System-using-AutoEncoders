# Recommendation-System-using-AutoEncoders

# AutoRec-Movielens

## Project Overview
AutoRec-Movielens is a recommender system built using autoencoders to predict user preferences for movies based on the Movielens dataset. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in creating personalized recommendations.

## Features
- Uses the Movielens 100K dataset, which contains 100,000 movie ratings from thousands of users.
- Implements autoencoders in PyTorch to capture the latent factors associated with user preferences.
- Offers insights into the effectiveness of deep learning for recommendation systems.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Dataset
The Movielens 100K dataset used in this project can be downloaded from the [GroupLens](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip) website. This dataset includes user ratings, movie metadata, and demographic information about the users.
